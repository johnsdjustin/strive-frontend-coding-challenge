## Description

This is my attempt at the [Strive Frontend Coding Challenge](https://www.notion.so/Frontend-Coding-Challenge-1a18c4de482540aebe51b43d648adf6f). 

## Run Locally

In order to run the project locally, you must:

1. Clone the repository.
2. If you haven't already, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Navigate to the root of the project folder and install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. While in the root of the project folder, start the app with `npm start`.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in the browser.
